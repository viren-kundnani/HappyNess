# HappyNess - Country Happiness Predictor

## Overview

HappyNess is a project that leverages the World Happiness Index dataset to predict whether a country is happy or not using a K Nearest Neighbour (KNN) classification model. The World Happiness Index provides a comprehensive set of factors contributing to a nation's happiness, and this project aims to classify countries based on these factors.

## Data Source

The project utilizes the World Happiness Index dataset, which includes features such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure accurate and meaningful predictions.

## Model

The classification model is built using the K Nearest Neighbour algorithm. KNN is a simple and effective algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class of their k-nearest neighbors. In the context of HappyNess, the model learns from the happiness scores of similar countries to predict the happiness status of a given country.

## Dependencies

- Python3
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Files

- `HappyNess-Viren Kundnani.ipynb`: Main notebook with Data cleaning, creation of the model, training, and testing.
- The 3 other csv files were used for classification, training and testing.

## Acknowledgments

The project relies on the World Happiness Index dataset, and credit goes to the organizations and researchers who compile and maintain this valuable resource.

Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute to the HappyNess project to enhance its accuracy and applicability. Happy predicting!
